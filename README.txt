Here are some subversion scripts that I wrote overtime and found there way on many places over the Internet.

I wanted to regroup them on github so that:
 1) They get improved over time
 2) I could fiddle with github a bit

This software is free for you to use, the free software definition from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Definition):

Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

In return I am asking that you keep the original credits in the source files, which you can augment with you own credits if you wish.
